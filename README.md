## Build History

[![Build history](https://buildstats.info/github/chart/skillshare/asdf-php?branch=master)](https://github.com/skillshare/asdf-php/actions)

## Prerequirements

Check the [.github/workflows/workflow.yml](.github/workflows/workflow.yml) for
dependencies, paths, and environment variables needed to install the latest PHP
version. To be honest, supporting a major version other than the latest without
any extra work from the user is an endless endeavor that won't ever really work
too well. It's not that we don't support them at all, but it's almost impossible
for us to support them.

## Installation

```bash
asdf plugin-add php https://github.com/skillshare/asdf-php.git
```

#### Note: PHP-PEAR

PHP PEAR is down without ETA for when the server will be back. To install PHP
without PEAR you can specify a `PHP_WITHOUT_PEAR` variable with any value
(except no), eg:

```bash
PHP_WITHOUT_PEAR=yes asdf install php <version>
```

## Usage

Check [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) readme for instructions on how to
install & manage versions.

## Global Composer Dependencies

After installing a global composer package you will need to run `asdf reshim`.

### Example

```shell
composer global require friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer
asdf reshim
php-cs-fixer --version
```
